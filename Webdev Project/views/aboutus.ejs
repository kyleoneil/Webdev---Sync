When it comes to diversity of heroes, abilities, and powerful items, Dota boasts an endless arrayâ€”no two games are the same. Any hero can fill multiple roles, and there's an abundance of items to help meet the needs of each game. Dota doesn't provide limitations on how to play, it empowers you to express your own style.</p>
